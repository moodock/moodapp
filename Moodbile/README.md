About SUSHITOS and Moodbile
===========================

    SUSHITOS is a Research group in the Barcelona Tech (Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya UPC).

    Founded in 2009 as a Research grup in the ESSI department, nowadays SUSHITOS gathers a group of
    faculty, PHD students and researchers from several Departments and Schools of the UPC.

    SUSHITOS has been acknowledged as an emergent research group by the Generalitat de Catalunya.

    The Moodbile project aims to enable mobile learning applications and other kinds of applications
    for education to work together with the LMS. Moodbile is an open source project.  The LMS Moodle
    is used as host LMS platform in the first stage of the project. Rather than just creating mobile
    applications that replicate the LMS functionalities on a mobile device, Moodbile provides the
    developers of applications for Education with the necessary tools to interact with the LMS.

    Moodbile is a project initiated by the SUSHITOS Research Group in collaboration with the GRIAL
    Research Group of the Universidad de Salamanca <http://grial.usal.es/>.

    The motivation of the Moodbile project is to open up the most commonly used e-learning platforms
    and LMS, originally designed as monolithic or layered systems, to the service paradigm.

    This work is an interoperability solution to extend LMS to other environments such as the mobile
    world. Its aim is to contribute in adapting LMS to the current generation of e-learning 2.0. Its
    first LMS target is Moodle.
