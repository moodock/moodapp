Moodbile Android Client is a GPL project continued after I finished my studies and work at UPC.

<http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/handle/2099.1/14074?locale=en>

I sent them updated libraries and other authors extended it but their code is not included here.

I don't know their current plans or project status, please contact them for further information.

I include Moodbile here only for testing purposes and to maintain compatibility with my future work.
